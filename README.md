# Important info; please read!
This is the 1.4 version of The Stars Above, now open-source for personal use and translation assistance.
Please read these short messages before viewing and/or utilizing any code in this project.

1. This mod was developed by one person with little to no prior experience programming. To this end, there will be glaring flaws in the mod's code, nigh guaranteed. I will NOT be accepting pull requests unless they concern translation, and issues with the mod should be brought up in the discord server (discord.gg/starsabove) instead of here. My reasoning is that through solving these problems myself, I can teach myself how to become a better programmer, and I would like this project to stay primarily in my hands. Thank you for understanding.
2. You are free to utilize any of my code with credit. This does not apply to the mod's art, dialogue, or other creative facets. Please understand that, outlined above, this code may contain issues that I have not addressed yet or lack the time to do so. If you would like my help with code and/or art, please DM me on Discord, and I'll try to help you to the best of my ability if I am available- no guarantees.
3. I develop this mod for free, and my time is limited. As I have to balance between art, programming, writing, and testing, sometimes I take concessions with programming. I will reiterate: please only use this mod's code sparingly and with prior knowledge in C#. Let me speak from experience: don't try to teach yourself programming with Terraria code. It isn't worth it- take a real class!
