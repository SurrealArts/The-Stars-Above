The Stars Above is a Terraria expansion mod that adds
a new important game mechanic: the Starfarer system.
Compatible with multiplayer and all popular content mods.

Meet Asphodene and Eridani: twin Starfarers, spatial
foreigners that will grant you strength on your journey.

Unlock unique equippable abilities within the Stellar Array,
mixing and matching them to perfect your build.

Obtain incredibly powerful Stellar Novas to decide battles,
and then modify and upgrade your Stellar Novas with
Stellar Prisms.

With hundreds of unique dialogue lines for each Starfarer,
become stronger with their guidance,
and arm yourselves for the challenges to come.
Your Starfarers will also have dialogue for modded bosses!

Obtain extraordinary weapons with layers of strategy
and myriad powers to overwhelm your foes. Every single
weapon is incredibly unique and custom-made.

Defeat six powerful unqiue bosses boasting a custom AI system:
Casted Attacks. Adapt and learn to defeat these powerful foes!

The adventure doesn't stop with your home planet. Journey
to the stars above, exploring ancient ruins, collecting alien
relics, and more.

This mod grants nearly limitless player agency; you decide
how you want to play.

Thank you to Subworld Library and Scalar's Structurizer for resources used to create subworlds!

This mod is meant to be utilized in tandem with other mods to enhance the gameplay experience.

Fully compatible with multiplayer, but there may be some desync issues.
Compatible with saves, but highly recommended to start a new playthrough.
